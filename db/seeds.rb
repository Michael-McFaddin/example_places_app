# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# places = Place.create([
#   {name: "Ted Johnson", address: "120 Spring Ave., Los Angeles, CA"}, 
#   {name: "Olivia Barker", address: "42 Space Lane, Mont Claire, NJ"},
#   {name: "Tina Smith", address: "18 George St., Orlando, FL"},
#   {name: "Mike Edwards", address: "145 Jackson Ave., Greenville, SC"},
#   {name: "Troy Evans", address: "1506 Ruby Circle, Auburn, MA"},
